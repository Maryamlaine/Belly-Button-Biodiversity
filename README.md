# Belly Button Biodiversity 
An interactive dashboard was designed to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. 
* A horizontal bar with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 operational taxonomic units(OTUs) found in that individual. 
* A bubble chart were designed to show each sample with a marker that hovers over each point.
